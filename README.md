# TurtleProject
A small Unity project done with the help of Saku Huuha (SakuH) and Niko Hämäläinen. The idea was to learn how to use Unity with microcontrollers and sensors. The project consists of a 3D turtle that can change its position based on the movement of gyro and the animal will start complaining depending on how warm or cold the environment is (heat sensor). The C# scripts in Assets folder were my tasks.
